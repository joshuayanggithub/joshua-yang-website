# This site is under development

This was a 3-day project where I learned html, React and ES6 JS, and tailwind all at the same time from scratch. Although it is nowhere close to complete, I realize I will have little time to complete it after school break ends due to getting my priorities straight. Thus it is public repo for now. Hardest part was formatting CSS. I belive Tailwind is hard for someone who has never learned CSS before.
