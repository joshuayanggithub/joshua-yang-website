## Project

Simple website design project I made in couple days. I learned html, ES6 and earlier JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS at the same time, so it was a bit challenging.

## Fixed Need in Future

Undestand npm peer-dependencies
Implement text-animation by self WITHOUT installing pre-made components like done
Better react-icons
Overall, continue to learn React syntax (as well as native JS)
