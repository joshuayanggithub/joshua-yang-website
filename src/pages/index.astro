      <h3>about</h3>
      <p>
        I study CS at CMU, specifically in Deep Learning and Robotics. Otherwise, I also like systems and theory-heavy math coursework.
      </p>
      <p>
        My broad interests are robot learning and generative models. My current focus is to gain more experience in robot learning and gain more knowledge in NLP areas. I am currently conducting research at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">CMU Robotics Institute</a> related to real2sim cloth folding.
      </p>

        Very eager to <span class="highlight-red">connect</span> with you if you share the <span class="highlight-red">same interests</span>
